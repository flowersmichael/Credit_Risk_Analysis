# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Assessing credit risk using supervised learning


## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to solve the real-world challenge, credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we need to use multiple different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the **balanced accuracy scores** and the **precision** and **recall** scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
